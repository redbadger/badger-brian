Dapr(y) version of Badger Brain

Currently, this repository is just a playground for Badgers to try out [Dapr](https://dapr.io) in a real world scenario.

We'll be gradually building up a version of [Badger Brain](https://github.com/redbadger/badger-brain), using Dapr, but obviously there's nothing production ready about any of this (yet)! ðŸ‘€

We are recording architectural decisions as we go, using [Lightweight Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)](https://adr.github.io/) â€”Â you can read them [here](docs/adr/README.md).
