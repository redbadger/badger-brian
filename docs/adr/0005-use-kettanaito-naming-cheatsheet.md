# 5. Use naming conventions from https://github.com/kettanaito/naming-cheatsheet

Date: 2021-04-28

## Status

Accepted

## Context

- Naming is hard!
- There is no naming convention for the project yet
- There are multiple valid ways to name things, but life is easier when only way way is used within a project (for example, do we say countDirectReports, directReportsCount, numberOfDirectReports and so on)

## Decision

We will name things according to https://github.com/kettanaito/naming-cheatsheet. This is short and simple and covers the majority of cases. We will consider extending it with specifics for this repo if the need arises.

## Consequences

We will need to spend less time thinking about new names

We will spend less time code reviewing / arguing about names

Names will provide reliable information about their target.
